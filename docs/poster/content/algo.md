# Focus on the Algorithm, not the Language

Developing algorithms in C++ can be cumbersome. New projects require non-trivial set-up,
and distinct code-compile-execute iterations make it hard to incrementally develop a new algorithm.
This is because they separate the code from its results and there is no easy way to debug and visually analyze the current state of the program.
All these issues have been resolved within the Python ecosystem, and `ogdf-python` now makes these solutions available for graph drawing use-cases.
Thanks to this, implementing known as well as new algorithms becomes much easier.
