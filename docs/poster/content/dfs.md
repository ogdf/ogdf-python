# Build portable Graph User Interfaces

Combining `ogdf-python`'s graph display widget with the UI elements provided by Jupyter's `ipywidgets`
allows you to easily build platform-independent user interfaces for interacting with graphs and algorithms.
In our example below, this is used to build an animated visualization of the individual steps performed by the
depth-first-search algorithm on a graph.
This can for example be used for teaching an algorithms course.
